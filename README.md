## Requirements

- a NetMD recorder
- USB cable (most use USB Mini-B)
- Chromium web browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.) or any other browser that supports both WASM and WebUSB

## Installation

### macOS
_it just works ®_ ... no need to download or install any software. Safari is not currently supported; please use a Chromium browser instead.

Some macOS-specific issues are documented in the [troubleshooting page](https://www.minidisc.wiki/guides/webminidisc/troubleshooting) of the user guide.

For macOS developers, see [here](#development-on-macos).

### Linux
Follow the instructions from the [user guide here](https://www.minidisc.wiki/guides/webminidisc/requirements#linux) or [the linux-minidisc project here](https://github.com/glaubitz/linux-minidisc/tree/master/netmd/etc) to grant your user access to the device. If you skip this step you'll likely get an *Access denied* message when trying to connect.

If you use a "packaged" version of Chromium, such as from the Ubuntu Store, you will encounter more issues. [Refer to the user guide for more details.](https://www.minidisc.wiki/guides/webminidisc/requirements#packaged_browsers)

### Windows
The Windows USB stack requires a driver to be installed before using Web MiniDisc Pro. The driver installation requires Administrator privileges. 

[See the full details in the user guide here.](https://www.minidisc.wiki/guides/webminidisc/requirements#windows) - it is usually as simple as using [Zadig to install the driver.](https://zadig.akeo.ie/)

Note: restart your browser after installation.

### Chrome OS
Works without any addtional set up - tested with 91 stable (91.0.4472.102). If your user account or device is managed (by your school or company) you may run into issues. If you are using a personal Google account on a personal Chromebook you should be good to go.

## Differences between [Web Minidisc](https://github.com/cybercase/webminidisc) and Web Minidisc Pro
Web MiniDisc Pro was forked from the original Web MiniDisc to provide a more advanced workflow for interacting with NetMD devices. 

In addition to the standard NetMD features that Web MiniDisc provides, Web MiniDisc Pro also features:
- The ability to connect to NetMD units available on the local network with the help of [Remote NetMD](https://github.com/asivery/remote-netmd-server)
- Downloading tracks from the player via standard NetMD commands (Sony MZ-RH1 only)
- Improved handling of pre-encoded ATRAC3 tracks
- Song Recognition
- The ability to use an external ATRAC3 encoder for better audio quality when using LP modes

*The following features depend on Factory mode commands. See [netmd-exploits](https://github.com/asivery/netmd-exploits/) for a list of supported devices*
- Downloading tracks from any Sony (or Aiwa) NetMD device
- Firmware and RAM dumping 
- TOC manipulation
- Tetris

## Development

Development discussion and coordination happens through the [MiniDisc.wiki Discord server](https://minidisc.wiki/discord) in the #research channel

### How to build

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you can run:
- `npm i` to install the required node modules (`--legacy-peer-deps` might be required for newer node.js versions)
- `npm start` to start the development server
- `npm build` to build for production

WASM modules are provided in the `public/` directory. However, if you wish to build those binaries yourself, instructions are provided in the `extra/` directory.

-----
### Development on macOS

#### Install Xcode Build Tools CLI & Homebrew
In macOS Terminal run:
- `xcode-select install` - to install XCode Command Line Tools
- `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` - to install Homebrew

After homebrew is finished installing,

#### Install gcc & libvips

In macOS Terminal: `brew install --build-from-source gcc`, wait for it to finish then run `brew install vips` (this command may install gcc again from an available pre-built binary, if one exists for your current macOS version, this is normal behaviour as gcc is needed for vips to work).

#### Proceeding with installation

With the above prerequisites done, you can continue the build process as described in the [How to Build](#how-to-build) section

### How to contribute
If there's a feature you'd like to see implemented in Web MiniDisc Pro, feel free to submit a pull request.

### Bugs and issues
Feel free to submit any issues as a GitHub issue. Web MiniDisc Pro is a hobby project and the developers cannot make guarantees about timeliness of bugfixes. If you have the skills to implement fixes yourself, we're more than happy to review pull requests.

### Forks
Web MiniDisc Pro and its predecessors are GPL licensed. You are free to fork or clone and create your own instance. However we ask that you:
- Change the name and description so that users do not confuse your fork with the upstream project
- Update bug reporting links to your own repo rather than this upstream one
- Remove the included reference to the LP encoding server provided by the MiniDisc Wiki project, or contact them for permission to include it
